# TGSC-Fix-Extension
This is an interim solution for fixing the issues on https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/

All I'm doing here is adding the existing css code from TGSC (with an addition that blocks the broken displaying of sponsors, sorry)


Here's how to install this (according to ChatGPT):

# Installation Instructions for Chrome Extension
Follow these steps to manually install the extension in Chrome:

## Download the Extension:

- Download the repository as a ZIP file by clicking on the Code button and then selecting Download ZIP.
- Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

## Open the Chrome Extensions Page:
- Open Google Chrome.
- Enter chrome://extensions/ into the address bar to open the Extensions page.

## Enable Developer Mode:
- Locate the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions page.
- Turn on "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch. This will enable the ability to load unpacked extensions.

## Load the Unpacked Extension:
- Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears in the top-left corner after enabling Developer mode.
- Navigate to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file.
- Select the folder and click "Open". The extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.

## Verify the Installation:
- Visit https://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/ to verify that the CSS and JS are being injected properly.

Note: Extensions installed in this manner are not automatically updated through Chrome. To update to a newer version of the extension, you will need to repeat the process with the updated codebase.
